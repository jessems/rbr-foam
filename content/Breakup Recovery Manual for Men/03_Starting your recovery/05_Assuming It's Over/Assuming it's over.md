## Assuming it's over

You might not want to admit it yet – and not a whole lot of guys are able to – but your relationship is most likely beyond saving. If she initiated the breakup and you’re shocked, then she’s way ahead of you in processing this whole thing. She probably saw it coming months ago and has been unconsciously preparing herself for this moment. 

It’s very, very, very hard to say goodbye to the future you undoubtedly imagined together. I’m not going to deny that. And I can’t make you do it. I can say, however, that this is the single most important thing you will have to do, to get through this. You need to accept it’s over and commit yourself to moving on. Because as long as you don’t take that step, you’re holding on to hope, you’re holding on to expectations, and you’re going to get painfully disappointed.

You need to accept it’s over and commit yourself to moving on. Sometimes it’s helpful to realize that we can love someone without it ever going to work.

If you feel you cannot assume it’s over just yet: fake it until you make it. Go no contact, go through all the motions described in this book and observe how your feelings and thoughts transform as you go no contact and gain clarity over time.
