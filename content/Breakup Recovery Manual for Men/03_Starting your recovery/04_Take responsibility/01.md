## Taking responsibility for your own happiness

One of the natural reactions to adversity is viewing yourself as the victim of some external circumstance. 

We find ourselves in pain and ask “what caused this?” The answer, invariably, is something external. 
 
Often, however, the pain we feel is caused, in part, by ourselves. Or at least, propagated by ourselves. 

No one is going to make you happy. It’s no one’s job, except yours.

Blaming others or external circumstances for your misery, is not going to lead to your happiness. Blaming keeps you stuck in victimhood, because blame implies there is a victim.

Instead, choose to stop investing time in those things that are outside of your control and take responsibility for those things that are.

Start with taking 1% responsibility.

Nothing can change until you take responsibility for your own recovery. Break the habit of feeling 100% victim and start by taking 1% responsibility. [@griefrecoveryhandbook]()
