### Progressing

There are two main forces that can help you move forward and move from protest to despair and beyond.

The first is a gradual, increased awareness and acceptance of the reality that the relationship is indeed over. 

The second is fatigue from suffering which culminates in the realization that no one is worth all this pain.

Going from protest to despair can feel like falling into a bottomless pit of nothingness. It is the moment we give up, stop fighting and let the full impact of the loss sweep over us.

Both the protest phase as well as the despair phase are stages you will need to go through to recover from your breakup. 

Those that are in the protest phase are generally not open to advice on how to recover from their breakup. Instead they are preoccupied with thoughts of getting her back and they dream about some kind of reunion in the future.

It is only when someone reaches the despair phase that they are open and ready to start recovery.

It is not uncommon for the phases to co-exist. You may want to fight for your ex one day and want nothing more than to move on the next. 

Lastly, there are some things that can be helpful to know at this stage that tend to hold true for most breakups:

1. The first couple of months are usually the most painful.
2. In general, tomorrow might be worse than yesterday, but next month tends to better than last.
2. If not constantly re-activated through thoughts, encounters or experiences — the pain will naturally decrease in intensity over time.
2. If re-activated, the pain will return and retain much of its intensity.
4. You will invariably be caught off-guard and become overwhelmed by an emotional bout.
5. You will think you're over her, only to discover you're not.
6. You will think you're never going to get over her, but if you want to, you will.
7. You will feel like no one understands you.
8. She feels like the one.
9. Intellectually you know it’s over, but you still hold some lingering hope.
10. You don’t want her or the relationship back, yet you miss something about what you had.
