### This can be harder on you than on her

Generally, the initiator of the breakup has an easier time getting over the relationship.

If you’re reading this, more often than not, you’re not the initiator. So that will make things a bit harder on you.

Breakups do not come out of the blue. Usually there will be signs that the relationship has gone downhill, but it’s not until long after that we’re able to see them.

It’s often the initiator who has picked up on this, consciously or unconsciously, and decides to end the relationship. This makes them better prepared for the situation after.

What complicates things is that the best predictor for a breakup is not how you view the state of your relationship but rather how you view your alternatives. You’ll tend to stay in a shitty relationship if you have no alternatives, but you’ll leave a decent relationship if you have an even better perceived alternative.

Lastly, men are often more dependent on their partners. As a rule, men tend to have fewer ties to relatives and friends and men are more likely than women to value their relationship over their family [@whywelove](). 

So while your ex-girlfriend might have a network of friends and family that are able to support her during these times, you may be much more on your own. Another reason this may be harder on you than on her.
