## What you may feel

If you’re reading this book, you’re likely going through some very painful and powerful emotions.

These emotions can be so intense and so powerful that they will impair your judgment and severely affect your capacity to think clearly. 

In order to alleviate the pain you are feeling, it is helpful to develop an understanding of your current condition that is grounded in reality. 

On the one hand recognizing a painful thought or emotion you’ve had as something that many other guys have gone through can make this whole thing a little less personal - a little less lonely. 

On the other hand you might discover that what you held to be true about your situation is in fact merely a common distorted belief. Reading about it may help you recognize it and overcome it.

After studying and writing about this topic for years and talking to hundreds of guys, I have identified various recurring  patterns exhibited by guys in the aftermath of a breakup.

### Common Emotions

If your ex-girlfriend initiated the breakup you might first be filled with shock and disbelief. 

In most cases there is a point where reality starts to sink in, and you realize that you are in the process of losing the most important person in your life.

Note how I mention that it feels _as if_ you’re in the process of losing this person. Things may already be beyond the point of no return, but it _feels_ as if there’s still hope.

Virtually everyone goes through a “protest” phase where they want their ex back no matter what.

If protesting and arguing doesn’t work, you may resort to begging and pleading your ex-girlfriend to reconsider.

You may promise you will change or do whatever it takes.

At this stage you may get stuck, unable to accept the reality that your relationship has definitively come to an end. Unable to accept that you will no longer be together with the person whom you still love.

It is this state of not accepting reality and continually seeking to change the unchangeable which relentlessly fuels your suffering.

Only when you’re able to give up the fight and come to terms with the end of your relationship will you be able to move on to the next stage of recovery.

Here you may fall into a state of “despair”, characterized by feelings of deep sadness, hopelessness and feeling lost. Having accepted that this is the end of your future together, the loss overwhelms you. Life feels empty and grey and there doesn’t seem to be a point to anything anymore.

In both states of “protest” and “despair” your emotions may get so intense they become absolutely horrifying.

Believe it or not it’s normal to feel like you’ve made or are making the biggest mistake of your life. It’s also normal to feel like you’re not getting any better and that you will be miserable forever.

The states of protest and despair are not mutually exclusive, nor are they sequential. You may very well go back and forth between them. This can be very confusing. One day you may feel devastated about the definitive end of your relationship, but the next day you find yourself holding on to a sliver of hope.

In addition, you may have many unanswered questions related to her and the current situation. We’ll have a look at those later on. These questions tend to feel very important — if only you could have them answered! Truth is, everyone has them. They are a symptom of your current condition and part of the unrelenting parades of thoughts and emotions that will pass through you the coming days, weeks and months.

Those are just the broad strokes. Here are some more specific things you might be feeling:

- Emptiness
- Loneliness
- Hopeless
- Powerless
- Fear you will never see her again
- Fear she will find someone else and be happy
- Anger
- Sadness
- Shock
- Disbelief
- Heartache to the point of physical pain
- Not sleeping, not eating
- Depression
- Isolation
- Lustlessness
- Despair
- Loss of confidence
- Loss of purpose
- Reduced concentration
- A sense of numbness
- Changed eating habits
- Roller coaster of emotional energy

It can be very difficult to come to terms or even make sense of all these things. To complicate matters, you may also feel conflicting emotions at the same time.

- You may feel angry and sad at the same time
- You may love her yet hate her
- You may never want to see her but be afraid of never seeing her again

This is completely natural and normal. The authors of _The Grief Recovery Handbook_ even include this phenomenon in their definition of grief:

> Grief is the conflicting feelings caused by the end of or change in a familiar pattern of behavior. 

Then, you may also feel emotions about your emotions.

- You may feel fearful of the pain lasting forever
- You may feel frustrated that you have no confidence
- You may feel tired of the roller coaster of emotions
- You may feel no one understands your situation or what you feel
- You may feel bad about yourself that you’re taking this long to recover

All this may be very overwhelming and very difficult to deal with. It’s also very difficult for me to make all this any easier for you.

But, take some refuge in knowing that you’re not alone. If you recognize any of the above it’s because scores of guys have come before you and have suffered just like you and have talked about their experience.

Also, perhaps more importantly, this whole thing you’re going through — it will pass. Nothing you feel will last forever. Everything passes.

Having said that, the above list is by no means exhaustive. You may be feeling things I do not mention here, and that’s perfectly okay. In fact, as we will learn, everything you feel is okay.
