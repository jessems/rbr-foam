# Understanding her behavior

Often we are left with many questions following a sudden breakup. Why did she do this? What is she thinking? Why has her behavior changed? How could she do this to me?

In my experience we can get some limited levels of relief by answering those questions, however we must also see them as a symptom of your condition.

What do I mean by that? The protest phase is characterized by an intense focus on your partner. Your feelings of love heightened and you want to fight for the relationship. One of the results of this focused attention is that you start asking many questions focused around your ex in an attempt to make sense of things.

Once you’ve passed the Protest phase, the answers to these questions won’t seem as important. One year from now, you won’t even care. They’re a symptom of your current condition.

In this chapter we’ll shed some light on the ones we can meaningfully answer and we will focus on making peace with never fully understanding the others.
