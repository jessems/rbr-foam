## How love works

What we have traditionally referred to as “love” may consist of multiple modalities. Author of _Why we love_ Helen Fisher identifies three modalities of love: Lust, Attachment and Romantic Passion. These modalities can operate alongside one another as she explains in her book:

> You can fall in love with someone from a different walk of life whom you never wish to marry. And you can feel romantic passion for one person while you feel deeply attached to another, usually a spouse. Moreover, you can have sex with someone for whom you feel no romantic love, even feel romantic passion for one individual while you copulate with another [@whywelove]().

So we can feel attachment-love for someone, yet not feel lust-love or romantic-passion-love. This helps explain the infamous words: “I love you, but I’m not in love with you”. It seems likely that the person employing those words feels attachment-love, but not romantic-passion-love for the other person.

One important realization is that love is not a choice. You do not choose who you fall in love with, it just happens. Similarly you do not choose when you fall out of love or who you fall out of love with. This also just happens.

It’s also important to realize that these processes operate at an unconscious level. We like to use our conscious minds to turn our feelings and behaviors into a story that makes sense to us, regardless if it’s true or not. As David Brooks, author of _The Social Animal_, puts it:

> The conscious mind merely confabulates stories that try to make sense of what the unconscious mind is doing of its own accord[@socialanimal]().

These unconscious processes can steer our behavior in ways that we are not consciously aware of.

For instance, rather then arriving at a conscious decision to cheat on our partner, we might find ourselves going out more, and unbeknownst to the conscious brain, putting ourselves in situations conducive to our unconscious desires.

So if our ex is behaving in a certain way, asking her why she is doing so may not yield a meaningful answer. Or, the answer she provides may be a confabulation of her conscious mind, not reflective of reality.
