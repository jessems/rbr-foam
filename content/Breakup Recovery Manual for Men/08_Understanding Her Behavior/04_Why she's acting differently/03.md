### Conflict seeking behavior

A pattern I observed towards the end of my own relationship, but also a pattern I've experienced many guys report, is one where your ex seems to steer the relationship towards conflict.

Right before they broke up, a friend of mine and his ex went on a holiday trip to Cuba together. It was supposed to be an unforgettable romantic adventure, instead it became the sad ending to their relationship.

On one of the first days my buddy and his ex were shopping. They were trying to determine what to cook for dinner but the conversation turned into an argument. My buddy described it as conflict seeking behavior where she freaked out about something as trivial as him suggesting chicken for dinner.

Right before my ex slept with another guy, I had become very suspicious. For the first time ever I checked her phone and encountered a very suggestive conversation between her and a guy she told me not to worry about.

When I confronted her about it she exploded and turned the incident into a conflict about me trespassing on her personal boundaries by checking her phone. 

In my experience you can often see conflict seeking behavior on display towards the end of any relationship, not just romantic ones. I think itâ€™s something we do to make it easier to sever the bond when the relationship comes to an end.
