## How could she move on so fast?

A common pattern I’ve noticed in breakups is one where your ex-girlfriend seems to move on surprisingly quickly. Perhaps she starts dating someone new only a few days after your breakup, or she just seems to be handling the whole thing better than you.

It can really seem like she is getting over this quicker than you are. How is that possible?

I’ve come up with, what I believe to be, a fairly good approximation of what is going on.

For one, if your ex has moved on seemingly quickly, it may have to do with her attachment pattern, which might very well be anxiously attached. A study from the University of Toronto has found that anxiously attached individuals can more easily let go of their ex-partners if they focus on someone new. What they observed is that anxiously attached individuals are naturally pessimistic about their chances of finding someone else. As a result of this pessimism they long for their ex-partners when broken up and put up with more ‘crap’ during their relationship in order to feel secure.

The authors found that by changing the outlook of these anxiously attached individuals from being pessimistic about their prospects of finding a new partner to being optimistic, the feelings of longing for their ex-partners could be reduced. How could this outlook be changed from pessimistic to optimistic? As the authors admit, a rebound relationship, for one, could have that effect, but also simple optimistic suggestions could result in reduced feelings of longing as well.

Take pause for a minute and truly understand what the authors are saying here. They are saying that simply by giving a woman optimistic suggestions they can reduce her longing for her (ex-) partner. 

If something as trivial as optimistic suggestions can change her feelings about you, imagine what genuine interest from another guy could do. This effect cannot be underestimated.

If your ex-girlfriend has an anxious attachment pattern, she may have stayed with you only because she was pessimistic about the alternatives.

This fits into the social exchange model view of relationships which posits that human relations can be viewed as the result of subjective cost-benefit analyses and the comparison of alternatives. According to this view one chooses to leave a relationship based on a comparison with alternatives and not solely by a dissatisfaction with the relationship.

If your relationship with your anxiously attached girlfriend was in bad shape, she might have stayed with you because she was pessimistic about finding someone else. However, her pessimism could have been reduced by, for instance, a cute guy showing some interest in her. With that the option of leaving you may now have become more appealing to her than staying.

I believe this is why you ex-girlfriend’s behavior can seem erratic, going from “I love you” to “I love him now”, seemingly overnight. If that’s the case, I also believe there’s another way looking at the situation:

Your relationship wasn’t going to last anyway.

The fact that your girlfriend was able to move on so quickly is testament to her being anxiously attached and her being dissatisfied in the relationship. 

On top of that your ex-girlfriend, at some level, was likely dissatisfied with the relationship. And you – as you’ll gradually come to understand – were probably dissatisfied as well.

Your relationship should provide you with more energy than you invest into it. You must feel unconditional love for your partner and feel the same in return. If your relationship did not fit that description, it’s probably better left buried.
