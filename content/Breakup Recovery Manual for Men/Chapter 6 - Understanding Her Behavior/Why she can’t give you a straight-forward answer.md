### Why she can’t give you a straight-forward answer

I think there are several reasons why your ex won’t be able to give you a straight-forward answer.

1. She is not emotionally aware. Basically, she herself does not know, on a conscious level, what is going on. So how could she possibly explain it to you? You need to look at her actions and draw your own conclusion.
2. She doesn’t want to hurt you. Perhaps the truth is that she has fallen out of love with you and that may be too difficult for her to tell you in your face. 
3. She is unable to articulate what is going on. If her feelings towards you have transformed from romantic love to just attachment, how would she know how to communicate that? 
4. She doesn’t want to destroy her relationship with you. If she thinks that the truth may make you angry with her, she may withhold it from you hoping the both of you can stay on good terms.
