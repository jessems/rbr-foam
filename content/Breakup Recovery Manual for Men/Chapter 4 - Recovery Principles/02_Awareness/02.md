### Becoming the observer

Awareness allows us to become the observer of ourselves.

We can become aware of ourselves *in real-time*. This is often also referred to as “mindfulness”. This allows us to observe the world around us as it happens and choose our responses to external stimuli.

> Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. 
> — _Viktor Frankl_

We can also become aware *retroactively*, by examining past emotions and behaviors. Retroactive awareness is a good place to get started when you want to become more aware in general.

Journaling is one method of retroactive awareness. By its very nature journaling forces you in to the role of observer, which creates a distance between you and the emotions and behaviors you’re journaling about.
