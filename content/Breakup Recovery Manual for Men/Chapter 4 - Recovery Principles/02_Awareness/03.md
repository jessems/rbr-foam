### Focus on what you can change

Awareness of your thoughts and emotions empowers us to question their veracity. Often times we will be preoccupied by the things that are not supported by facts or that are outside of our control. 

Being able to distinguish — and drop — those things that are beyond your control is incredibly powerful.

> If you find you’re here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it or accept it fully. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences, no excuses. No negativity. No psychic pollution. Keep your inner space clear.

Thinking about what your girlfriend is feeling or is thinking is a example of something that may occupy your mind but which is beyond your control.

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
> The courage to change the things I can,
> And the wisdom to know the difference.

#### Exercise: Change it, leave it or accept it

When you're facing a tough situation ask yourself:

1. Is this something I can change?
2. Is this something I can leave?
3. If none of the above, learn to accept it, any other decision will lead to suffering.
