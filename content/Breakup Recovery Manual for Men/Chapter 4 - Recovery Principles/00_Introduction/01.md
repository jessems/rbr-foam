# Recovery principles

Broadly speaking there are two approaches that are helpful in dealing with a breakup. 

The first is gaining perspective through understanding and thinking by decomposing what we’re going through into individual emotions, processes and phenomena. Decomposing a larger experience and labelling its constituent parts activates the rational areas of the brain and has a calming effect that helps us gain perspective on our predicament. 

The second, is by not-thinking and instead embracing the here and now, whatever it has to offer. We embrace whatever emotion it is that we are feeling without judging it or ourselves. When an emotional wave is allowed to wash over you with all its might, it loses some of its energy. Only when we surrender to the scariest fears do they pass through us without resistance.

Both approaches are helpful and compliment one another. Although reading and thinking can give you better, more accepting perspective on things, you cannot think your way out of misery.

Similarly, being present and mindful will help you process your emotions and become more balanced, you will still need your thinking modalities to survive and thrive in your day-to-day life.

In the following sections we will cover both approaches in more depth.
