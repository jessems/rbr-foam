## Social bonding

Our emotional lives are largely housed in a region of the brain called the limbic system and so is the bonding mechanism you use to connect socially with other people. This leads to a situation where your ability to connect with others influences your mood. We are truly social animals.

> When we are bonded to people in a positive way, we feel better about ourselves and our lives. This capacity to bond then plays a significant role in the tone and quality of our moods.

Bonding with others will have strong, positive effect on your mood during these times. We will look at becoming a more social person, recruiting a breakup buddy and recruiting a support network to leverage this.
