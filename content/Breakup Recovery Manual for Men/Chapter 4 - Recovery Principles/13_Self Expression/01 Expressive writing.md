### Expressive writing

Expressive writing is a therapeutic technique where you write down your deepest thoughts and emotions related to a certain topic. The process of writing down these emotions allows you to vent the negative energy you’ve associated with the topic. 

The long-term benefits of expressive writing include improvements in physical health and mood, feelings of greater psychological well-being and reduced depressive symptoms. Although it doesn’t reduce the frequency or amount of intrusive thoughts you may have, it has shown to reduce the intensity of the negative feelings those thoughts trigger.

Although I haven’t seen it explicitly confirmed by research, my belief is that expressive writing trains you in the skill of observing your behaviour, thoughts and emotions.

I recommend using the technique of expressive writing in two different contexts:

1. Letter to your ex. Using the technique of expressive writing you will write a letter to your ex in section: “Saying Goodbye”.
2. Journaling. Practice expressive writing in your journal on a daily basis. 

Here is how to use the technique of expressive writing:

### Instructions

Write down your very deepest thoughts and feelings about the most important emotional issue that you are facing. In your writing, really let go and explore your deepest emotions and thoughts. 

You might tie your topic to your relationships with others, including parents, lovers, friends or relatives; to you past, your present or your future; or to who you have been, who you would like to be or who you are now.

You may write about the same issue every day, or different issues every day. All of your writing needs to be completely confidential. Lastly, don’t worry about spelling, grammar or sentence structure.

Writing is for you, unless you want someone to read it. Write for 20 minutes and leave 10 minutes to compose yourself afterwards.
