## Self-expression

When we express ourselves we are venting our emotions and to a certain extent processing our emotions.

If you write a letter to your ex in which you include your biggest emotional struggles, you will notice that you will feel relief after putting those emotions on paper.

The same applies to different forms of self-expression. In this chapter I talk mostly about writing, but I encourage you to explore other forms of self-expression such as art, poetry, music etc.
