### Other forms of self-expression

I encourage you to explore other areas of self-expression. After my breakup I was particularly drawn to poetry. Here is a poem I wrote during that period (translated from Dutch):

> It drags you down continuously,  
> even when you try your best to live on,  
> when you try to touch the feeling, to rationalize it,  
> it turns out to be an iceberg which you can't sail around,  
> that floats after you when you try to escape from it,  
> and that overtakes you when you stand still,  
> it is so god damn lonely.  
> Of course it is because you're in this alone,  
> no one out there understands you,  
> the world loses all its depth,  
> because that depth I had only with you,  
> and you, I no longer have.
