### Journaling

Journaling amounts to the activity of writing every day. Use the instructions in the section on expressive writing to guide you in the process to get maximum benefits.

Other ways you can use your journal:

#### Tracking thoughts and mood

If you’re struggling with obsessive thoughts or a certain recurring emotion, try tracking their intensity and/or frequency in your journal. 

You will train yourself to become more present and aware of what is going on inside your head. You will find that the very process of tracking will reduce the intensity and frequency of that what you’re tracking.

#### Give your future self advice

Thoughts and emotions, by design, are intended to immerse you in a trance. When you are lost in the trance, you are not aware you are in the trance. This is where the trance has power over you.

In those moments that we are present and aware, we are able to see the trance for what it is. Invariably, however, we will once again get caught up in the trance.

In your moments of awareness and clarity, you may write down insights you feel are important and little nuggets of advice for yourself to help snap out of the trance.
