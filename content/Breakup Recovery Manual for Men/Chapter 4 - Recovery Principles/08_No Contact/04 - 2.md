### Don't try to stay friends

Staying friends doesn’t tend to work.

In fact, the more space you have while getting over a break up, the greater your ability to heal and move on.

Guys often maintain the hope of staying friends because they are not ready to let go.

Fully disengaging is one of the most effective ways to get over your break up. This will allow the emotional storm to settle. That, in turn, provides you with the mental clarity to reflect accurately and honestly on your breakup.

Quit any attempts you’re making to stay friends with your ex, and do not respond to any attempts she makes.

Just because you’re broken up, doesn’t mean your feelings are now turned off. The opposite is in fact true, your brain circuitry for romantic love fires up even more when you’re faced with rejection. You can’t be friends while you still have feelings for her.

Let your ex girlfriend know that you do not believe that it is not possible to stay friends while trying to get your lives back on track.
