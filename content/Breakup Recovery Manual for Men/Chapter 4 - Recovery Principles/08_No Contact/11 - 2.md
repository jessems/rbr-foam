### Not fully going no contact

Beware what can happen when you donâ€™t fully go no contact:

> Then, yesterday I saw her Facebook and that she is in a relationship with a new guy. I felt a feeling I have never had before. My stomach dropped, and I've had that before too, but it seemed surreal. Like, well there goes any hope I had. 
> 
> Exercise and support group are strong right now. No contact has been good in every respect except looking at Facebook but hopefully that will be remedied now. i really have been feeling a ton better about myself and my new life in the last couple weeks and its only been disrupted by the flood of emotions that comes form looking at her pictures on Facebook.
