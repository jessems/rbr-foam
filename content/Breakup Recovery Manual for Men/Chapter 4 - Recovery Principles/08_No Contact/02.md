### The importance of no contact

No contact is not about your ex-girlfriend, it is about you. 

It is not a weapon you can use to wage war with your ex nor does it magically inject happiness into your life.

Your happiness is your own business. No contact is about reclaiming control and responsibility over that area of your life.

No contact is about accepting that you are no longer connected to your ex-girlfriend and letting go of the connection you once shared. 

How they respond or interpret your decision to sever communications is their business, not yours. 

No contact is not a statement. It is a stage you need to go through and it is a process in and of itself.

No contact is about you deciding that you are going to take measures to no longer to get hurt by maintaining a relationship that hurts you more than it does you any good. It is about grabbing the steering wheel and taking back control over your life.
