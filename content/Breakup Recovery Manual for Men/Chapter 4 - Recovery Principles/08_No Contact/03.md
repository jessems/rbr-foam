### Why the no contact rule works

No contact is so hard because your body is craving for interaction with your ex-girlfriend. But your body doesn’t “know” that the mode of interaction with your ex-girlfriend has changed. Your body doesn’t “know” that you’ve broken up.

You’re feeling withdrawal symptoms to a love addiction. Researchers have identified similarities in the way love affects your brain to the way addictions do. In many cases, the same neural pathways are activated.

Love, however, can be a tremendously positive force in your life. But as soon as the love is not reciprocated, the addiction changes from a positive, constructive force, to a negative, destructive one. 

You are now, all of a sudden, an addict displaying some of the worst and most intense withdrawal symptoms, craving for another hit of the addictive substance: your ex-girlfriend. Not surprisingly, the best thing to do is to abstain from the addictive substance.

Renowned anthropologist Helen Fisher did an experiment where the brain activity in recently dumped college students was monitored while they were given pictures of their exes to look at. As it turns out viewing a picture would light up their brains like fireworks, eliciting a strong emotional response. This is what’s happening in your brain every single time you see, or hear about your ex.
