## Positivity

We are wired to view and remember our experiences in a negative light. This built-in pessimism helped our ancestors survive by making them extra risk adverse.  

I believe this negative bias often becomes stronger during a breakup, because the same wiring is at work, the stakes are only higher.

The benefits of adopting a positive mindset are well-established. Among them are lower stress levels, stronger immune system and a better sense of well being. Positive thinking is not some wishy washy new-age technique. It is a scientifically supported technique which we can adopt as a daily habit.

It is easy to get sucked into a spiral of negativity. The breakup has emotionally wounded you and you feel mentally and physically exhausted. Anything is going to feel difficult, even rudimentary activities such as sleeping or eating can become impossible.

Again, it is easy to view this in a negative light. The more you view as negative, the more new negative things will pop on your radar. It's simply how we're wired.

Instead, we must counter-act this spiral and infuse ourselves with positivity. 

### Positive Momentum

In order to get into the habit of thinking positively it is helpful to put extra emphasis on your successes. Try celebrating small victories. Did you feel the urge to contact your ex, but didn't? Celebrate your victory. Log it in your journal and give yourself a treat.

Did you go to the gym even though you did not see the point? Celebrate the victory. Take the time to congratulate yourself. Practice self-compassion and build positive momentum.

#### Exercise: Training positivity

Find a place where you can observe people walking by. Perhaps a bench at the park, or a bustling shopping street, or you could even do this at work.

Now for every person that passes by come up with one thing you like about that person. It can be something about their appearance, something about their demeanour — anything. You’re only task is to find one positive thing per person, then move on to the next.

Observe how difficult this is for you. Do this for 10 minutes. Try again next week. Has it gotten easier?
