### Everything is an experiment

In his book 'The Power of Habit', Charles Duhigg lays out the best strategy to overcome habits. Habits are behavioral patterns that have been stored in our brain so we can run them on autopilot and use our remaining brain power to focus on day-to-day tasks.

Research has found that the most successful way of breaking a habit and changing behavior is by treating every attempt as an experiment. 

Treating an attempt as an experiment does two things:

1. It limits the scope of our commitment. We are not committing to quitting a certain behavior forever. 
2. It implies and inspires an honest, fact-based approach to the challenge. An experiment typically involves a hypotheses ('I think this approach might work') which is tested against empirical evidence ('Did this work for me?'). If this evidence does not support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is disregarded and a new experiment with a new hypothesis is set up.
