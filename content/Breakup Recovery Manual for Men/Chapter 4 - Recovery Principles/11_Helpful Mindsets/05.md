### Pain is a lesson for you to learn

Pain is a natural response that focuses our attention on significant events and promotes correction or avoidance of those events in the future.

Said differently, pain brings a lesson to our attention so we can avoid or correct behavior that was deadly or detrimental to our ancestors.

Because pain is a natural mechanism in our brain that evolved millions of years ago, it is very primitive in comparison to say our ability to reason, or our linguistic abilities, which evolved millions of years later.

Although the lesson is still there for you to become aware of, the message itself is communicated to you in the primal language of the brain that is literally millions of years old. 

This helps explain why the feeling feels so raw, so true, so strong.

Not only is the lesson broadcast in a language that may be foreign to you, it can also overwhelm your ability to understand it in the first place.

Almost by design, do these messages, these emotions, take you out of consciousness and immerse you in their intensity. 

But you know what? These messages exist for a reason. 

Ponder this for a second:

You exist today because every one of your ancestors was able to reproduce.

We can thank our emotions, and pain in particular, for that.

The challenge, then, is twofold. We must become aware of these lessons as they manifest themselves, and secondly we must teach ourselves to interpret them and act on them if necessary.
