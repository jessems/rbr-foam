## Self-compassion

There is an almost continuous dialogue going on in our heads where we talk back to ourselves. We may speak encouraging words when we’re trying to achieve something and we may use angry words when we fail.

The type of dialogue we have with ourselves says a lot about the type of relationship we have with ourselves. If we’re mean, condescending and unforgiving, our relationship with ourselves can probably be characterized in the same way.

Conversely, if we’re patient, compassionate and understanding in our internal dialogue, we set the tone for a patient, compassionate and understanding relationship with ourselves.

It turns out that if we’re not compassionate towards ourselves we struggle to let emotions go, because we tend to have secondary feeling to the initial emotion. 

For example, you may be sad that you’ve lost future plans with your ex. Because you’re not practicing self-compassion you become angry at yourself for being such a wussy. The initial emotion is sadness, but you’ve just added anger to the mix.

Self-compassion means that you accept the emotions that arise, whatever they are. The act of accepting them as they are, allows them to dissipate. This is way it is beneficial to practice self-compassion.

#### Exercise: What would I do if I loved myself?

There is a question you can ask that can help you identify how to practice self-compassion in a given situation. Ask yourself: If I loved myself, would I do X? Or: If I loved myself, what would I do?

After my most recent breakup I went to a friend’s bachelor party and someone offered me a cigarette. I had been in the habit of smoking occasionally, especially when I was feeling down, so a cigarette seemed particularly appealing. 

In a moment of clarity I asked myself “If I loved myself, would I smoke a cigarette right now?” It became very clear to me that of course the answer was no. In an instant it became easy to turn down the cigarette. That’s the power of this question.
