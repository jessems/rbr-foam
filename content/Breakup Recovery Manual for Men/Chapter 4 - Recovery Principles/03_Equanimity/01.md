## Equanimity

Equanimity is a state of mind where emotions pass through you without resistance. You reach equanimity when you can observe your emotions without judging them.

Being aware of our emotions is helpful, but only when we learn how we can be aware _and_ be equanimous, do our emotions start to lose their power over us.
