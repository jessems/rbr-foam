### Labelling emotions

One way to train ourselves to become more equanimous is by labelling our emotions.

The act of labelling allows us to objectify thoughts and emotions and distance ourselves from them. The more we utilize the center of our brain that names feelings, the less negative consequences we feel from them [@Lieberman:2007gq]().

Next time you feel a strong emotion, try to pause for a second to observe it and label it. Be careful not to judge it as you label it.
