# Introduction

“I lost my soulmate…”

I remember uttering those words while Skyping with my mom. It must have been right after my ex-girlfriend told me she slept with another guy. 

I had never been as sad and as lost as I had been in that moment. I was convinced I had lost the most important person in my life, the person I was supposed to share my life with forever, my “soulmate.”

I felt deeply, deeply betrayed. I felt that the one person in the world that I had opened up to had stabbed me in the back.

Although this feeling of betrayal was one of the most painful and most intense emotions I had ever felt, it paled in comparison to the sadness that pierced my soul once I realized that I had lost her forever.

Despite her no longer wanting to be with me, despite her having had sex with another guy and despite our relationship being riddled with arguments and devoid of sex — I was still willing to do anything to get the love of my life back.

I was willing to forgive her for *everything* she had done as well as change *anything* about myself. Just to get her back.

It was only much later, after a lot of reflection and personal growth that I was able to look back and see that I had come to depend on my ex-girlfriend and the relationship to define myself.

What’s more, she had become more important to me than myself. I had in effect lost myself in the relationship.

Recovery, for me, became a process of looking inward and finding new meaning to life. Meaning that does not come from your partner but meaning that emanates from a core version of yourself.

Your girlfriend should not be someone that completes you and you should not be someone that completes her.

You are complete as you as are, and so is she. Believing otherwise may be an indication that you are not fully accepting of yourself. And very often that is where the root of the problem lies.

Luckily we can learn to become accepting of ourselves. 

Not everyone reading this book will have lost themselves in their relationship. Most people experience some pain after breaking up. In this book we talk about general advice that will be helpful to most as well as specific advice for whom the breakup has become a devastating and disruptive experience.

Recovery, in any case, is not a linear process. You will need to focus on yourself and take steps to  move on. At the same time you’re still going to have to deal with some of the realities of the breakup: the emotions, the thoughts and the circumstances.

Often it’s pretty obvious what step you need to take next in your recovery. The challenge, however, is not so much “knowing what to do”, but “knowing how to get yourself to do it.”

You’re going to get washed over with powerful emotions that may debilitate you, distract you and occupy you relentlessly. 

It might surprise you to hear that we’re not going to “overcome” or “get rid of” any of them. 

Each emotion is a gift. It is a signal your body is sending you. By listening to our bodies we can learn the lessons our emotions are trying to impart on us without getting trapped in endless ruminations.

Through this book I hope to help you seize the breakup as an opportunity to rethink your life. Now is a time to shake things up.

You may feel broken. If so — that’s okay — see this as an opportunity to build yourself up again brick by brick.

Part of me sympathizes with you and feels sorry that you must go through this pain. But another part of me is also happy for you, as crazy as that may seem right now, because I know where you are, and I know for a fact that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. There always is.

Not only do I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel for you personally, I believe it shines brighter than anything you’ve ever experienced before. I consider it my privilege to be able to show you this light.
 
This book is a culmination of my insights, experience and research surrounding the challenges of recovering from a breakup. 

I felt dissatisfied with the lack of useful information out there for men that go through difficult breakups. I felt a resource should exist, so I started blogging on the topic back in 2012.
 
And now, after several years of blogging, I’ve set out to create the book I wish I had had at the time. 

Although I cannot remove all your pain, I believe that by reading this book you can avoid some very painful mistakes, process your feelings head-on and set yourself up for future success in relationships and in life.

May you find the strength you need to get through this.
