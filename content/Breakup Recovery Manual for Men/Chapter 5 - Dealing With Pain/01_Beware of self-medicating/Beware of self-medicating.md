## Beware of self-medicating

If, during this time, you have been eating excessively, drinking alcohol, doing other drugs, or feel the urge to do so, realize that this is your body trying to self-medicate the pain it is feeling.

You have found a way to self-medicate yourself for the pain you are feeling. If anything, that is a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of your body.

It turns out that certain channels of relief — although effective in causing relief — cause problems of their own.

Others, are less destructive. 

The death of a loved one, divorce, and all other losses produce an incredible amount of emotional energy. Since we have all been socialized from early on to deal with sad, painful, and negative emotions incorrectly, we end up storing the energy inside ourselves. 

To illustrate this point, imagine a child coming home from school with his feelings hurt from being bullied by classmates. The child’s caretaker asks “What happened?”, to which the child responds that one of the kids was mean to him. The caretaker says “Don’t cry, here have a cookie, you’ll feel better,” setting the child up with a lifetime belief that feelings can be fixed with food.

Upon eating the cookie, the child feels different, not better, and for the moment is distracted and forgets about the incident on the playground. However, there has been no completion of the emotional pain caused by the event 

Early on we learn to cover up, hide, or bury our feelings under food. It is not surprising that sometime later we adapt that same behavior and cover up our feelings under alcohol or other drugs. 

Food and alcohol are obvious and typical short-term energy-relieving behaviors. There are many, many other short-term behaviors that have the same life-limiting and damaging con- sequences. 

- Food 
- Alcohol/Drugs 
- Anger 
- Exercise 
- Fantasy (movies, TV, books) 
- Isolation 
- Sex 
- Shopping 
- Workaholism   

Most of these actions are not harmful in and of themselves. They become harmful when you engage in them for the wrong reasons. 

As we will see later on in this chapter, emotional energy can build up inside us and we will automatically seek to relieve it.
If not handled properly, this is when we may start participating in the short-term energy relieving behaviors.

> There are three major problems with STERBs. The first is that they work, or more accurately, they appear to work. They create an illusion of recovery by causing you to forget or bury emotions. The second problem with STERBs is that they are short-term. They do not last, and they do not deal with the true emotional issue. And lastly, they do nothing to remove the cork that is jammed in the spout. In fact, most people don’t even realize that there is a cork in the spout[@griefrecoveryhandbook]().
