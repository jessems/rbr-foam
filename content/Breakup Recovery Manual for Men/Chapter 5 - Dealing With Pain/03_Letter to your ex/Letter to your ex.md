## Letter to your ex

In this section you will put to use what you learnt in the section on Expressive Writing. You will write a letter to your ex-girlfriend without ever sending it. 

### Exercise: Write a letter to your ex

Before you start, take a moment to take stock of how you feel right now. When you think of your ex-girlfriend and your past relationship, what feelings come to the foreground? After taking stock, continue with the rest of the instructions.

Write a letter to your ex. It can be on your computer or you can do it with pen and paper.

Get everything off your chest. Put the most intense emotions you’re experiencing into words. Don’t leave anything unsaid and take as long as you want to do this.

A close friend of mine did this in a Google Doc and every time he thought of something to add, he would open the doc and add it to the letter.

Once you’re done, once again take stock of how you feel. Do you feel better? Do you feel relieved? Do you feel like you want to send the letter? How have your feelings changed compared to before you wrote the letter?
