## Limiting beliefs

Sometimes the way we feel about something is connected to an underlying belief we have. These beliefs can become a source of pain and suffering for us. By coming to understand what these beliefs are and that they have no basis in reality, we can learn to overcome the emotions they are connected with.

As an example, you may believe that you are not good enough the way you are. As a consequence you may feel fear that you might be exposed as a fraud by your peers. By recognizing and dismantling this underlying belief of not feeling good enough, we can get rid the feelings of fear.

Based on the work of Byron Katie, here are five questions you can ask yourself to uncover and dismantle a limiting belief:

1. What am I believing?
2. Is this really true?
3. What is it like to live with this belief?
4. What stops me from letting go of this belief?
5. What would my life be like without this belief?
6. Who would I be if I no longer lived with this belief?

As an example, while writing this I can tell you that I’ve been feeling self-conscious about my receding hairline.

1. What am I believing?
	I believe my receding hairline means there’s something wrong with me, I’m not as good as others and I’m ugly.
2. Is this really true?
	A receding hairline is perfectly normal. By the age of 35 two-thirds of western men experience appreciable hair loss. It’s random. Many women also find bald men attractive.
3. What is it like to live with this belief?
	Very limiting, at times it creates anxiety and frustration and makes me a closed person.
4. What stops me from letting go of this belief?
	Nothing, really.
5. What would my life be like without this belief?
	I would feel more confident, more free, more happy.
6. Who would I be if I no longer lived with this belief?
	A happier, more confident, more at-peace version of myself.

Doing this exercise makes me realize how unhelpful it is to hold this belief and how it’s not based on reality. As a result, it loses its power.
