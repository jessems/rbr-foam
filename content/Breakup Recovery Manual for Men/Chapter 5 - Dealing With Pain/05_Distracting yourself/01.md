## Distracting yourself

Without resistance an emotion can pass through you in a fraction of a second. It is only when we cannot fully accept the reality of the emotion that it triggers a cascade of thoughts and more emotions.

When this cascade is triggered many neurons are firing together and re-establishing pathways that keep our misery in the foreground. 

When we are able to avoid this firing by becoming completely engaged with something else, we allow the neural connection to age and atrophy. We also avoid the emotional trance that ensues.
