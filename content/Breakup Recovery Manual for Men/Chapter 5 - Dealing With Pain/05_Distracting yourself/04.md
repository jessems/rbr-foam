### Nature and travel

You can distract yourself in many ways, some better than others. For instance you can watch an entire season of the Sopranos, which Iâ€™ve done and I can recommend, but an even better distraction would be getting out into Nature. 

There is something about Nature, specifically grand displays such as mountains or the ocean, that leave you in awe. They just cut through all the thoughts and emotions and make you feel the connection that exists between you and mother nature in a visceral way.
