### Novel activities

Distract yourself by doing novel activities. 

Start trying out activities, sports, hobbies that you’ve never done before. If it’s something your ex disapproved of or was never willing to do with you — even better! 

Novelty is correlated with our feel-good chemicals in our brain. So if we do something that is new to us it may give us good, positive feelings.
