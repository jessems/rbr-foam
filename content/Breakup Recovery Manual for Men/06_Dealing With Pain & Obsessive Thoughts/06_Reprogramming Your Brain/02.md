### Knocking her off the pedestal

When we're in love we distort our perception of reality in favor of our partner. We tend to think or partner is more attractive than they truly are [@scienceofrelationships](). We can break this spell and develop a more realistic view of our ex through the exercises laid out in this chapter.

#### Exercise: List of negative traits

1. Make a list of your ex’s negative traits. Perhaps it’s hard to come up with many negative traits in the first sitting. Add to the list once you realize or remember a negative trait.
2. Email some of your friends that were familiar with your ex. Tell them you are trying to get a realistic view of your ex and you are making a list of negative traits. Ask them to name some of her negative traits. Add them to your list.
