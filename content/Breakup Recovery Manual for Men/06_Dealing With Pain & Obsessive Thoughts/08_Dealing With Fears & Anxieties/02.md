### Progressive relaxation

_This relaxation technique is adapted from “Buddha’s Brain”[@buddhasbrain]()._

In progressive relaxation you focus systematically on different parts of your body, working either from the feet to the head or vice versa. 

Depending on how much time you have, you might focus on large sections of your body—e.g., left leg, right leg—or on much smaller units, such as left foot, right foot, left ankle, right ankle, and so on. 

You can do progressive relaxation with your eyes open or closed, but learning to do it with your eyes open will help you relax more deeply if you’re with other people.

In order to relax a part of your body, simply bring it into awareness; for example, take a moment right now to notice the sensations in the bottom of your left foot. Or say “relax” softly in your mind as you bring awareness to a body part. Or locate a point or a space in that part. Whatever works best.

For many people, progressive relaxation is also a great method for falling asleep [@buddhasbrain]()
