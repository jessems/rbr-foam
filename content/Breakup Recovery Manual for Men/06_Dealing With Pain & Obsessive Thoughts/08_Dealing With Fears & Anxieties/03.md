### Diaphragmatic breathing

_The following exercise is adapted from ‘Buddhas Brain’[@buddhasbrain]()_

Relaxing engages the circuitry of the PNS and thus strengthens it. Relaxing also quiets the fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system, since relaxed muscles send feedback to the alarm centers in the brain that all is well. When you’re very relaxed, it’s hard to feel stressed or upset. In fact, the relaxation response may actually alter how your genes are expressed, and thus reduce the cellular damage of chronic stress.

The next method—diaphragm breathing—takes a minute or two. The diaphragm is the muscle beneath your lungs that helps you breathe; actively working it is particularly effective for reducing anxiety.

Place your hand on your stomach a couple of inches beneath the upside-down V at the center of your rib cage. Look down, breathe normally, and watch your hand. You’ll probably see it move only a little bit, and sort of up and down.

Leaving your hand in place, now breathe in such a way that your hand moves out and back, perpendicular to your chest. Try to breathe into your hand with real oomph, so that it travels back and forth half an inch or more with each breath.

This can take some practice, but keep at it and you’ll get it. Next, try diaphragm breathing without your hand so you can use this method, if you like, in public settings [@buddhasbrain]()

Breathe slowly and deeply, mostly with your belly.
