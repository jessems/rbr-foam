### Change your surroundings

Often our surroundings hold reminders of our ex and our relationship. Remember that these reminders can trigger a cascade of emotions and thoughts within us which tend to refresh and strengthen the pain we’re trying to dissolve. 

If we are able to stay present and equanimous, this isn’t a problem. We experience the emotion with full acceptance and it is not followed by a cascade. 

But it’s far more likely that we’re not at that stage yet where we’ve trained our mind to be present and equanimous. In these cases it can be very beneficial to put ourselves into a new environment without these reminders. The absence of reminders means that our neural connections to our pain will have time to grow weaker and dissolve.

An added benefit to a new environment is that novelty triggers feel-good chemicals in our bodies. So if you put yourself into a new environment you may be start to feel better fairly quickly! 

Shortly after my breakup in college I signed up for a student exchange program in Spain. It was the best thing I could have done. The new environment and new social circles allowed me to fully engage with something new.

Although I didn’t feel completely recovered right away, it did allow me to start to feel better rather quickly.
