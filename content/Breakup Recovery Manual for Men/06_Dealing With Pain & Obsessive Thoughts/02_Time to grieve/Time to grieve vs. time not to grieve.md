## Time to grieve vs. time not to grieve

As I’ve mentioned earlier in this book, emotions are lessons for us to learn. The most effective way to deal with emotions is to be present with them so we can truly experience the lessons they are trying to teach us. 

In the case of sadness this means allowing yourself to feel sad. In the case of anger this means allowing yourself to feel angry. You get the idea.

We’re not always in an environment where we can express our emotions freely. If you’re at work, it’s understandable you don’t want to break down in tears (but realize that it’s completely okay if you do!)

Choose when and where you grieve your relationship. Sometimes it may not be a good time to grieve. In those cases, while being compassionate with yourself, postpone the grief to a later time.

When you postpone your grief, it’s important to not forget about it. We build up emotional energy which needs to be released or else it will come bursting out unexpectedly and uncontrollably.

Pick a specific time and place in your day when you can allow your grief to come to the foreground.
