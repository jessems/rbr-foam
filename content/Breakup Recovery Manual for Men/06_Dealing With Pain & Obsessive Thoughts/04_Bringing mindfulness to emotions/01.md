## Bringing mindfulness to emotions

An emotion can seemingly come out of nowhere and sweep over you in a fraction of a second. If you are present and equanimous there will be no resistance and the emotion will pass as suddenly as it came about. 

If we allow ourselves to get carried away in the trance of the emotion, however, there will be resistance and you will experience suffering. 

This is the key difference between pain and suffering.

In this section we will learn how to bring mindfulness to our emotions so we can allow them to pass without resistance. This chapter is almost entirely based on the work of Tara Brach detailed in her books _Radical Acceptance_ and _True Refuge_.

One way to start off is by asking yourself: Am I fully accepting of my current situation? Often this question points us to what is asking for attention.
