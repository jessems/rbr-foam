The fastest way to avoid more pain than you’re already feeling is to make sure you don’t see your ex-girlfriend anymore and aren’t reminded of her anymore.

This is incredibly simple advice, but can be very hard to follow. If you do, you will feel the benefits.

So much for avoiding more pain — what about recovery? What is the fastest way to get over this? 

Pause for a second.

If this question occupies your mind, let’s see where it’s coming from first.

Ask yourself this: Am I fully accepting of my current situation?

If the answer is yes, great! You have nowhere else to get to and have no reason to concern yourself with doing so quicker.

If the answer is no — dig deeper. What are you not fully accepting of?

Observe whatever thought or feeling surfaces. Do not judge — just observe. (Hard, I know. Perhaps even overwhelming)

_That_ is your next step.

Whatever surfaces is the reason that is making you ask how you can recover quicker.

Whenever we are suffering it is because we are not accepting of something. 

The act of observing, without judgment, will allow whatever you’re not accepting to pass through you without resistance.

This may lead you down a long winding path of self-discovery, but it’s the only type of recovery that will truly make a difference in your life.

Forget about the “fastest” way to recover. The best way to recover is to cultivate awareness for what is passing through you and compassion for anything you encounter.
