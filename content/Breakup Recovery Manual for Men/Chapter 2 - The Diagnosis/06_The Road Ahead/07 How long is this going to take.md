### How long is this going to take?

For us to be able to answer this question, we need to take a look at what influences the length of a recovery.

**Length of the relationship** — A longer relationship generally means you’ve grown very attached to your partner, thus dealing with a breakup will be harder and will likely require a longer recovery.

**Emotional awareness** — Emotional awareness is the extent of which you are aware of your emotions, their effect they have and your ability to deal with them. Suppressing your emotions is not a shortcut to healing, it will prevent you from truly recovering.

**Adverse childhood** — Your upbringing is a time when your ‘working model’ for relationships and affection are formed. Various things can distort your model which can lead to an unhealthy relationship.

This means that it’s very hard to estimate how long your recovery is going to take. That being said, there is a rule of thumb which gives you an idea of the time scale involved:

*It will take you half of the length of your relationship to get over it.*

That’s not set in stone, but it should give you somewhat of a frame of reference. If you just got out of a five year relationship and went through a gut wrenching breakup, don’t expect things to be ‘back to normal’ in a month or two. In fact, it’s perfectly normal to still feel some lingering effects 1 or 2 years after the fact.
