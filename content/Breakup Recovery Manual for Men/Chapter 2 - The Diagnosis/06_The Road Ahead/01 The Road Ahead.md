## The road ahead

In the previous section I covered why it is that you are currently experiencing pain. 

You might ask yourself, how long is this pain going to last?

There’s no straight forward answer, nor is it straight forward to describe the road ahead. For one, because everyone’s path is unique.

Secondly, your progress along this path is not going to be linear. You’re going to be taking two steps forward and one step back. 

When I say that, I’m not referring to your actions. I’m referring to your emotional state. You may feel more recovered one day, only to feel less recovered the next.

One day you may feel you’re ready to move on, followed by a day where you desperately want her back.

This is a non-linear process, but some labels can be helpful.

Academic psychologists and neuroscientists frequently use the distinction between the “Protest” phase of romantic rejection and the “Despair” phase.

I will speak in terms of the Protest phase and the Despair phase moving forward.
