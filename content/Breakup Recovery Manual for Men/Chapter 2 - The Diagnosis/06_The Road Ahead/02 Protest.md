### Protest

During the protest phase chances are you will fight the separation. 

> Spurned lovers also take extraordinary measures to reconnect with their former partner, revisiting mutual haunts, phoning day and night, writing letters, or incessantly e-mailing. They plead. They make dramatic entrances into a beloved’s home or place of work, then storm out, only to return and renew their appeal for reconciliation. Most become so focussed on this missing partner that everything reminds them of their sweetheart. 
> -- Why We Love

During this phase you might be pre-occupied with thoughts of getting your ex-girlfriend back rather than getting over her. You may be in denial about the relationship being over.

This phase is characterized by the so-called Romeo and Juliet effect. You will actually feel _more_ in love now that you have been rejected.

> Social or physical barriers kindle romantic passion. They enable one to discard the facts and focus on the terrific qualities of the other. Even arguments or temporary breakups can be stimulating. 
> -- Why we love

Your feelings can pervade your thinking. Everything might point to your relationship being over, yet you cannot accept it. You feel that there is still hope and even when you examine that feeling, you feel it is accurate and true, even though there may be no evidence for it.

When confronted with this lack of evidence, you do not concede. You attribute your faith to your heart, your feelings. It feels 100% true so it must be true.

If you find yourself predominantly in this phase, I typically cannot do anything for you. You have not given up yet, and until you do, I cannot show you the path to letting go.

With time you will realize that we don’t arrive at the truth through emotions. We arrive at the truth through reasoning and evidence. If you have no evidence, you have no basis for knowing  what is true.

What you are feeling is _real_ — but not _true_. It can be helpful to remind yourself of this distinction between real and true.
