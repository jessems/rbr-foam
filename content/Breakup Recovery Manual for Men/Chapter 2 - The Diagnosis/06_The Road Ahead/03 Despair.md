### Despair

Once you transition from the protest phase to the despair phase, life can feel meaningless. Your ex-girlfriend gave meaning to your life and without her it can seem dull, or even empty

Here's a poem I wrote while going through my breakup when I was feeling despair (translated from Dutch):

> No one understands me anymore,
> 
> the world around me has lost its depth,
> 
> that depth I experienced only with you,
> 
> and you, I no longer have

The despair phase is where you reach your rock bottom, but it is also your launch pad to a new chapter of your life.

> Eventually the disappointed lover gives up. Their beloved is gone forever and they are spent. Many plummet into hopelessness. They toss in bed and cry. Drugged by the potent liquor of sorrow, some just woodenly sit and gaze into a void. They hardly work or eat. Perhaps they feel an occasional urge to renew pursuit of their lost love or a passing flash of anger. Generally, they feel deep melancholy. Nothing pries them from their anguish — except time. — Why We Love

Paradoxically it is when you give up, when you surrender, that your recovery can truly start. You are now accepting the reality of the situation and allowing the sadness to sweep over you. 

This feels terrible. But just like something can _feel_ true, and not _be_ true. Reality can _feel_ terrible, but not _be_ terrible. 

No, there is a parade of emotions that is going to pass through you over the coming months. This sensation you are feeling is one of them. It may be loud now, but it will eventually die out, like all the others.
