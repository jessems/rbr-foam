## No contact, no reminders

There is a saying in the field of neuroscience: “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” 

The idea is that if certain neural pathways are activated simultaneously, your brain associates one with the other. So the next time, they will fire synchronously, even though only one is receiving input.

So if your brain has always associated a certain restaurant with with your girlfriend, going to that restaurant when your relationship is over will trigger thoughts and emotions about your ex-girlfriend. (Tip: Don’t go to that restaurant.)

We remedy this by going No Contact, and we include no reminders to be complete. 

The concept is simple: cease all forms of communication with your ex. Without exception. So no Facebook, texting or social media stalking.

No contact is not difficult to understand. It is, however incredibly difficult to execute.
