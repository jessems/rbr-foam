### Initiate No contact

Now that we understand no contact, itâ€™s time to take action.

Send your ex-girlfriend a concise message stating that you will be ending all forms of communication in order to focus on yourself and that you hope that she can respect that decision.

Make sure your message is:

1. Civil
2. To the point
3. You take full responsibility for this decision.
4. Leave no incentive for her to reply.

How you send it is up to you, so long you abide by the rules above. Here is a template:

#### No contact message

Dear \<First Name\>,

I have discovered that by having contact with you I am keeping myself stuck in the past and I am preventing myself from moving on.

I have decided that it is necessary for me to break off all forms of communication with you so I can truly open the next chapter in my life.

I hope you can respect my decision.

\<Your Name\>
