### Plan for your weaker self

I received this message from a reader who took it into his own hands to make sure he wouldn’t break no contact by using special computer software.

>  I just couldn't stop looking at their Facebook no matter how hard I tried and it was ruining any progress in healing I was making because they were posting so frequently about their new life of frequent travels and living it up everywhere. Anyway I finally decided to install Netnanny on all my devices and block Facebook and Instagram. I had my friend create the password for Netnanny and be the admin so I couldn't login. That has helped tremendously and I haven't looked at facebook in almost 2 months. I also had to ask friends and family to stop telling about my exes Facebook updates because they continued to be rude and arrogant even though I was being nice. Her boyfriend could have simply reached out to me directly like a man and just asked me not to contact her anymore and I would have stopped. Anyway it did reveal who she really is and what kind of life and relationship she really wanted. She's definitely not the girl I thought she was or wanted to be. That helped me be less attracted to her.
