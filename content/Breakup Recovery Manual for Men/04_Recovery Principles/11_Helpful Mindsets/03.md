### Without darkness there is no light

In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang describe how opposites or contrary forces are actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world. Not only that, but yin and yang give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. 

Many dualities such as light & dark and fire & water are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang.

I have come to view love and heartache in much the same way. If it weren't for you missing your ex-girlfriend, longing to be with her when you're not, you wouldn't value being with her in the first place.

In many ways it is *because* we have the capacity for feeling down when we are separated from our beloved that we have the capacity or feeling great when we're together.

Just as you wouldn't feel good about being with your beloved if being separated weren't painful, it wouldn't feel painful if it didn't feel awesome being together.

You could even say that the separation between pain and joy exists only in our heads, but in many ways they give rise to one another and form an interdependent whole in the natural world, analogous to yin and yang.
