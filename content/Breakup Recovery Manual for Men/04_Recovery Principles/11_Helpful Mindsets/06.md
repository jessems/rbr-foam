### That what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger

The original quote by German philosopher Frederich Nietzsche: "What does not kill me makes me stronger", has inspired many artists, politicians and public figures to adapt this powerful statement.

At its core it is a statement of resilience, but it touches on a fundamental truth in nature. 

Muscle growth is induced by first overloading muscle fibres and causing the micro fibrils that make up your muscular tissue to break. These cells will then heal themselves and make themselves stronger in order to withstand greater loads in the future.

In toxicology there is a phenomenon known as hormesis where small dosis of a toxin have a favorable biological response inhibiting the body to higher doses.

There is a law of nature at work here that applies to different domains. When our biological system incurs damage, so long it doesn’t kill us, it makes us stronger.
