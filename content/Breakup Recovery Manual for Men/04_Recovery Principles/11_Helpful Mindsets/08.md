### Progress not perfection

Although it is important to continuously strive towards improvement, it is equally important not to set the bar too high. It is only through setting goals and reaching them that we create a positive cycle which allows us to reach even bigger goals.

If you currently do not exercise at all and you want to adopt a routine where you exercise multiple times a week, having that end-goal in mind can become self-sabotaging.

Instead, it is better to focus on the next small step towards that goal. Perhaps going once a week for a month is a good first step.

Setting too big of a goal unnecessarily creates an all or nothing situation. We need to be aiming for little by little.

Similarily you might get frustrated with where you are in recovery, in life, in your career. Always take your starting point into account. 

After two weeks in the gym there is no point in comparing yourself with someone that has been going to the gym his whole life. Rather, compare yourself to where you were two weeks ago. It's about progress, not perfection.
