### You are responsible for your own happiness

Investigate the questions you ask yourself. Perhaps you've asked yourself "How could she do this to me?" That question implies that she perhaps was not *supposed* to do this to you. Or that perhaps you *deserved* better.

What you're doing in essence is resisting reality and holding on to some should-have-been reality in your imagination. 

No one is responsible for your happiness but you. We relegate the responsibility for our happiness to others. But we cannot control others. We can only control our own actions. Not even the outcome of our own actions.

Worrying about things you cannot control causes us to suffer. Since we can't control other people, we can't control their actions and we can't control how others respond to our actions, the only thing we can concern ourselves with, without causing suffering, is our own actions.
