## Meditation

Much like the section on physical exercise, I feel obliged to preface this section by telling you that I do not have the credentials to teach meditation and my experience is limited to my own forays into the field. Having said that, I think the instructions for meditation are very simple — it is the execution that can prove very difficult.

I meditate on a daily basis and try to do 10-20 minutes in the morning, and 10 minutes at any given time during the day if I find the opportunity.

Medical benefits of meditation include antidepressant effects, improved mood regulation, reduction in stress and anxiety, improved focus and a greater resilience towards pain.

In the aftermath of a breakup, I believe a daily mindful meditation practice can teach you how to:

1. Snap out of emotional trances and obsessive thoughts
2. Deal with a strong emotions
3. Garner insights about yourself, your relationship and your past
4. Improve your mood by reducing stress and depressive symptoms

We will discuss some meditations for specific situations in “Dealing with pain & obsessive thoughts.”
