## Physical exercise

Let me preface this chapter by saying that I do not have the credentials or the experience to advise you on the topic of physical exercise.

Having said that, I have browsed through the literature on the topic of how physical exercise influences the brain. That, combined with my personal experience form the basis for my recommendations in this chapter.

My conclusion is simple and boils down to this:

Science irrefutably shows that exercise has many beneficial effects. Among those particularly relevant to your situation are: improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control in addition to being a potent antidepressant as well as producing improvements in mood and self-esteem. Need I say more?

My recommendation is even simpler and boils down to this:

Find a way to do at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise every day, preferably in the morning. This will give you an immediate alleviation of some of the negative emotions you are feeling.

Keep it simple. Just run for 45 minutes. If you want to get into an advanced gym routine — great. Important thing is that you’re moving and doing so consistently.

### A note on motivation

Personally I’ve struggled with motivating myself to do exercise. Using my anger to get me to the gym has definitely worked, but is not a long-term strategy.

Having said that, the following way of looking at it has worked for me. I don’t know if it will work for you, but it’s been so effective for me that I feel compelled to share it:

First of all our sense of “self” is an illusion. What I like to think of as “me” is just a collection of cells that form a body. When it feels like something makes _me_ feel good, it usually means that something makes _my body_ feel good.

I have started as viewing my conscious self, separate from my body, as the caretaker of my body. I try to love my body, my illusory self, as much as I can and treat it as best as I can. Self-compassion all the way.

Sometimes it’s easy but sometimes it’s like applying tough love to a child. My body feels like it doesn’t want to work out, but my conscious self knows that if it is truly acting out of love it needs to overrule that feeling because it knows that afterwards and in the long run my body will not regret it and will feel good.

I imagine what I would do if I were the loving caretaker of this large mammal that I have come to recognize as myself. The answer tends to involve staples such as exercise, healthy eating and grooming even when the mammal doesn’t feel like it.

In essence I find my motivation through self-compassion.
