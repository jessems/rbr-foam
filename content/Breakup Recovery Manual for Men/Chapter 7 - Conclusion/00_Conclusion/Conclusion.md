# Conclusion

Congratulations on making it all the way through. We’ve covered a lot of ground and I genuinely hope that at least some of this has been helpful to you.

Breakup recovery is big topic and I’ve only been able to touch on some of the main points. I will be updating this book continuously and if you’ve purchased a copy I will make sure you have access to life-long updates. I hope, however, that this isn’t a topic you will need to revisit your whole life.

If this book is somehow incomplete, or if there are areas where you are struggling which aren’t adequately addressed — please let me know. Or if there is any other reason you would like to get in touch, please do so.

You can reach me at jesse@rapidbreakuprecovery.com

It may take a couple of days, but I respond to every single email.

All the best!

Jesse
