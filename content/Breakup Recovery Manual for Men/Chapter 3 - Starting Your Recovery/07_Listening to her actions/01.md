## Listen to her actions, not her words

For various reasons you might find yourself in a situation where you’re still hopeful there may be some future for you and your ex-girlfriend. 

First of all, know that this is the source of your pain. When you are hopeful that there will be some reconciliation in the future, you will suffer every time reality does not support that picture.

One way to snap out of this self-created bubble is to give more weight to your ex’s _actions_ as opposed to her _words_.

What is she conveying by what she is _doing_? Chances are she is being ambiguous with her words yet very clear with her actions. Listen to her actions, not her words.
