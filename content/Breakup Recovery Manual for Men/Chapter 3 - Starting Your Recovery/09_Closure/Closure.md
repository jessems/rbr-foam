## Closure

> You do not need validation or closure from your ex. Attempting to get it is a huge waste of your time and energy. It will make you feel drained and deranged, and will derail your healing. It is completely unnecessary and even dangerous. — _The Breakup Bible_

One of the biggest mistakes people make is going back to their exes seeking validation and closure.

The validation you crave is not going to come from your ex. It never does. We go through great lengths to try and get our partners to take responsibility, but they never do. The validation must come from within.

Know this: you are allowed to feel what you feel. This is your essential right. It is okay that you feel like crap and it is absolutely necessary that you accept your grief. Validating yourself and feeling your feelings is a vital part of the healing process. Accept your feelings and do not judge them.

I understand that you feel the need to get validation from your ex. You want her to accept some accountability, and truth be told, it would make getting over a breakup somewhat easier.

Unfortunately she won’t give it to you — and you don’t need it. Time spent trying to get it will be time wasted, getting yourself enmeshed for way too long. It will drain you and make you feel worthless, but more importantly, it prevents you from healing. We will discuss this more in-depth in _Understanding her behavior_.

Validate what you are feeling by saying “I feel X right now, and that is okay. It is a natural reaction to my breakup. I cannot control my feelings, but I choose not to suffer.”

Closure needs to come from within. All your questions will not be answered. It is only when we accept that certain things will remain unexplained, that we can get a sense of a closure.
