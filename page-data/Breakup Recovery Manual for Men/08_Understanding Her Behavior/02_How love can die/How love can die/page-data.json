These three modalities can operate independent from one another.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Secondly, each modality manifests itself as a cocktail of neurochemicals in our brain. Even though the human experience of love feels transcendent, it can be reduced to neural connections and chemicals in our bodies.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thirdly, love evolved as a reproductive strategy to motivate us to stay with our partner long enough to rear a child together. What better way to motivate us to stay with our partner than to convince us that they are the one and only person in the world that we can and should be with? Believing someone is \\u201Cthe one\\u201D is a key part of the reproductive strategy we are born with. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We are wired to assess whether someone of the opposite sex would make a good mate. As men, we look at a woman\\u2019s physical appearance to determine if she is healthy, fertile and carries healthy genes. Women also consider physical appearance, but often place more weight on a man\\u2019s social status and his ability  to protect and provide.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"These assessments we make are automatic, unconscious and involuntary. When we assess someone in a positive way, the result is that we become attracted to that person. Conversely, if the assessment is negative, no attraction is created.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our assessment of someone can also change, this will also happen involuntarily. We may start off having a positive assessment of someone and being attracted. If something in their appearance or in their circumstances changes, we may no longer assess them in a positive way and we may lose our attraction to them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Remember we said that women assess men, among other things, based on their ability to provide and protect. If a woman\\u2019s assessment of your ability to provide and protect went from positive to negative, she may have lost attraction for you in the process.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It\\u2019s difficult to say what women look at to determine a man\\u2019s ability to provide and protect but social status, health, income, confidence and vision are factors that are likely to have an influence. What that means is that a change in any of these factors could result in a woman losing attraction for you.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is why there are many stories of women leaving a man after he lost his job, after he put on some weight or after he lost focus of his vision for life. The factors that had made him attractive to begin with have now changed and she has in effect lost her attraction to this person.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A very common pattern I see, particularly with guys coming out of their first relationship is the following.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Both guy and girl are deeply in love. Often for both it\\u2019s their first serious relationship. The guy is so enamoured by his love and, wanting to be a good provider, puts his girlfriend at the center of his life. Motivated by love, he becomes willing to do anything and everything to please his girlfriend.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"His girlfriend slowly comes to dislike being the center of attention. She fell in love with a man with a clear direction in life. Now this same man increasingly seems to be taking directions from her. Slowly she begins to lose attraction and begins to feel suffocated by the attention she receives. She ends the relationship by saying she needs space. She may still feel affectionate-love for her partner, but the reality is she has lost romantic-passionate-love because the guy lost one of the traits that made him attractive in the first place.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is just one example how love can die in a relationship, but there are many more scenarios one can think of. It is also normal for feelings of lust and romantic-passionate-love to decrease over time in a relationship.
