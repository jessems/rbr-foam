Anyway I finally decided to install Netnanny on all my devices and block Facebook and Instagram. I had my friend create the password for Netnanny and be the admin so I couldn't login. That has helped tremendously and I haven't looked at facebook in almost 2 months. I also had to ask friends and family to stop telling about my exes Facebook updates because they continued to be rude and arrogant even though I was being nice. Her boyfriend could have simply reached out to me directly like a man and just asked me not to contact her anymore and I would have stopped. Anyway it did reveal who she really is and what kind of life and relationship she really wanted. She's definitely not the girl I thought she was or wanted to be. That helped me be less attracted to her.\\xA0\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"","private":false},"tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#plan-for-your-weaker-self","title":"Plan for your weaker self"}]},"outboundReferences":[],"inboundReferences":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/Breakup Recovery Manual for Men/Chapter 4 - Recovery Principles/08_No Contact/12","title":"12"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e28d166e-f127-5835-a3be-52e4a0079ba6","refWordMdxSlugDict":{},"tocTypes":["sidebar"]}},
